# TurboClone Project

This project was completed as part of a pair programming course following "The Rebuilding turbo-rails tutorial." The primary goal was to learn and apply object-oriented concepts in Ruby on Rails. Key features and concepts covered in this project include:

-   **Rails Engine**: Understanding and implementing Rails engines to modularize the application.
-   **Integration Tests**: Writing and running integration tests to ensure the application's components work together as expected.
-   **Helpers**: Utilizing Rails helpers to keep the code clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Project Overview

TurboClone is a simplified implementation inspired by Turbo from Hotwire. It focuses on real-time updates to web pages by streaming HTML fragments over the wire, enabling a smoother and more responsive user experience.

## Features

-   **Turbo Streams**: Real-time updates without full page reloads.
-   **Custom Renderers**: Adding custom response formats to controllers.
-   **Test Assertions**: Including test assertions to ensure the correctness of Turbo streams.

## Learning Objectives

This project provided hands-on experience with the following Ruby on Rails concepts:

-   **Engines**: Creating and working with Rails engines to encapsulate functionality.
-   **Integration Tests**: Writing tests that cover the interaction between different parts of the application.
-   **Helpers**: Using helpers to maintain clean and organized views.

## Usage

To use the TurboClone project in your own application, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Add TurboClone to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.
2. **Configuration**: Include the necessary initializers and configurations as demonstrated in this project.
3. **Testing**: Run the provided test cases to ensure everything is set up correctly.
